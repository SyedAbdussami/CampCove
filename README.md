# YelpCamp

This is a small Full stack project, that i build a s part of a udemy course taufgt by Colt Steele. I learned so many things during my journey in building an actual application hosted on the web. 

Although the technologies used here are quite old compared to the new standards today such as UI frameworks. I have put this work here to showcase my abilities and experiments in crafting such an application.
