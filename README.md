# CampCove

Welcome to CampCove, a small Full-Stack project that I built as part of a Udemy course taught by Colt Steele. This project has been a journey of learning and growth, as I built an actual application hosted on the web.

Although the technologies used in this project may be considered old compared to the new standards today, such as UI frameworks, I have put this work here to showcase my abilities and experiments in crafting such an application. I believe that my skills and experience in building YelpCamp demonstrate my ability to create high-quality, functional applications that meet the needs of users.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my experience and qualifications with you further.# YelpCamp
